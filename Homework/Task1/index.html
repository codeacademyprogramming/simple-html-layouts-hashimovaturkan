                        At the very young age of 16, he relinquished his citizenship of Germany. In fact, he'd rather be a world citizen than a 
                        nationalist. For some time he remained stateless until he accepted the citizenship of Switzerland in 1901.

                        There was only one female student in his class named Mileva Maric at the Zürich Polytechnic where he studied. 
                        Maric had considerable interest in science and maths. She aspired to be a physicist but once married she gave up her ambitions.

                    <li>
                        Interestingly, the FBI maintained a dossier on Einstein running into a whopping 1427 pages that contained information on his 
                        connection with socialist and pacifist organizations. In fact, Hoover wanted him deported according to the Alien Exclusion Act, 
                        but the American State Department overruled this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Einstein had a baby born out of wedlock in 1902, when Mileva was in Serbia, living with her family. The child was christened Lieserl 
                        who was either given away for adoption or died while still a baby. He never saw his daughter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Einstein divorced his first wife, and for her to agree to the divorce he offered her the money he got from the Nobel Prize which 
                        came to $32,250, a considerable sum in those days time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Einstein went on to marry his first cousin Elsa who was a daughter of the sister of his mother.4

                    <li>
                        Einstein was an avid supporter of free speech and civil rights. This made FBI maintain a dossier about him and wanted him out of the country.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many persons used to enter Einstein's house, stand in the patio, come down and get their photographs taken as if they were 
                        coming out of his house after meeting him. He used to let them do it if it gave them any pleasure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Einstein's son was suffering from schizophrenia and so was institutionalized for almost all of his grown-up life. 
                        After immigrating to America in 1933, he didn't see his son again.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Einstein had difficulty speaking and was unable to speak until he was four years old.
